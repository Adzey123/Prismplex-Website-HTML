                      The Azure SMP is Prismplex's permanent, peaceful SMP
                      server. The focus of it is to allow players to build, earn
                      money, and form teams and nations across the large map of
                      Azure's world.&nbsp;Azure first launched in August of 2022
                      and has been using the same world ever since, getting a
                      large expansion in Jul 2023 with the release of the 1.20
                      update and its new biomes.

                    <span>
                      Azure uses several plugins such as a land claim plugin, an
                      economy plugin, and McMMO. There are also three server
                      shops that allow players to exchange certain types of
                      wood, crops, and minerals for money. For items that can't
                      be sold to the server, players can also sell them on their
                      own by opening a shop at the central town, where plots can
                      be rented for players to build stores and sell goods or
                      services. Azure uses a custom plugin to prevent inflation,
                      allowing certain items to be sold only a certain amount
                      every 24 hours -- for a full overview of how the economy
                      on the Azure SMP works, see the Azure economy guide below!

                      Elections for the position of Azure's Mayor are also held
                      about every two months. To learn more about this, as well
                      as to see all of Azure's past mayors and an overview of
                      what each one did while in office, see the "Azure Mayor"

                      Many players on the Azure also make lore or develop their
                      character, creating unique backstories and tying them into
                      the overall history and lore of the server and the
                      characters of other players. To see an overview of the
                      lore and history of Azure, the library on the second floor
                      of the townhall is a great place to start!

                          starting his second term on 11/10/2022. However, this
                          was a rigged election planned by staff as a transition
                          to a major server update, which included his character
                          being the only option to vote for creating a
                          dictatorship with players not voting for him being
                          punished. During this stage Mary hired the Night's

                          be his personal guard detail. He also created laws
                          such as 100% tax to encourage players to rebel against
                          him. During this time many buildings were visibly
                          damaged and random fires were littered throughout the
                          town, plunging things into a state of chaos and

                          Sage did not make any major changes during their rule,
                          simply maintaining most of what already been
                          implemented by Mary.

                          After Sage's term had finished it came out that they
                          had been abusing permissions granted to the mayor role
                          of to have access to cheated items for their personal
                          use. Sage was later permanently banned from Prismplex
                          for unrelated reasons.

                          During his first term, Adzey initiated significant
                          changes, starting with the removal of taxes imposed by
                          Mary. He implemented several acts that defined
                          religion and charities on Azure, establishing
                          standards for them to follow. Adzey also attempted to
                          create a court system allowing players to sue and
                          defend themselves against mayoral decisions, though
                          this system was never fully implemented.

                          Adzey introduced an act around fines, enabling the
                          mayor to impose punishments on players. His term
                          emphasized enhancing communication between staff and
                          players. He also began removing inactive or poorly
                          maintained player shops, creating space for a fresh
                          wave of player-driven activity.

                          Adzey continued making changes. He orchestrated a
                          staff reset of the end dimension and continued to
                          clean up the town. Notably, Adzey led changes to the
                          server shops to prevent inflation without taxing
                          players. He reinstated limits on the number of plots
                          players could rent, a policy initiated by Mary and
                          revoked by Sage.

                          closed, allowing players to sell certain basic

                          resulting in 2000 blocks being dug in each direction

                          With the next election approaching, Rosie announced a
                          speech on Azure. Players gathered for the speech in
                          which Rosie announced that she would be taking over
                          Azure and becoming the Empress, with her empire,
                          Midgarde, gaining power. The election ran anyway, with
                          Wert, known now as TheLivingShadow.

                          The new rule over Azure commenced with the Midgarde's
                          banner around spawn, messages such as "LONG LIVE THE
                          MIDGARDE EMPIRE," and more becoming common.

                          The first change was adding potatoes as an alternative
                          to diamonds in the server economy. Soon after, taxes
                          were imposed at 10% of players owning, going to the
                          empire, and announcing those who do not agree are
                          enemies of the empire.

                          The resistance grew, and in an effort to have them
                          surrender, the Crimson King, DanX2M, was captured and
                          being held for execution if the resistance didn't
                          fight or surrender. The resistance never showed up,
                          meaning that Dan died, and the Midgarde's control was
                          undisputed on the server. It was quiet for a while.
                          For pride month, Rosie collaborated with the previous
                          mayor, River, to run an event where players could
                          commission artwork by finding pride tokens around
                          spawn; this was popular with players.

                        <span>
                          Soon afterward, due to a major update for the server
                          changing the economy and updating up to 1.20, the
                          Midgarde was requested by staff to leave the town.
                          Rosie released control, marking the end of her first
                          two terms as mayor/empress of Azure.

                          their role. Despite the brevity of their term compared
                          to past and subsequent mayors, BeehiveHalo undertook a

                          in navigating the town. Additionally, Bee organized a

                          town, ultimately resulting in the establishment of a

                          In December of 2023, Aria assumed the role of Azure

                          server. One of her initial announcements included the
                          appointment of Mia (HypnoNova) as her Vice Mayor for
                          the duration of her term. Together, they swiftly
                          collaborated with the server staff to establish new
                          laws.

                          One notable act introduced allowed the mayor to remove
                          players from plots in the town, addressing issues of
                          plot hogging and enhancing aesthetics by eliminating
                          unused or visually displeasing builds. Concurrently,
                          Aria embarked on a joint project with the server
                          admins to create a server history archive at spawn,
                          documenting the evolution of the server under her
                          leadership.

                        <span>
                          Aria's leadership also introduced a controversial
                          ruling concerning shops, initially limiting players to
                          selling one category of items with minimum prices.
                          Following discussions with players, Aria demonstrated
                          flexibility and adjusted the ruling to be more
                          equitable for all participants. Collaboratively with
                          her Vice Mayor, Aria initiated efforts to transform
                          the town into a more natural environment, implementing
                          custom trees and natural pathways connecting key
                          locations.

                          to ongoing improvements for the server's players. Her

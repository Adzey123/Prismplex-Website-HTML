                  The Azure SMP is Prismplex's permanent, peaceful SMP server.
                  The focus of it is to allow players to build, earn money, and
                  form teams and nations across the large map of Azure's
                  world.&nbsp;Azure first launched in August of 2022 and has
                  been using the same world ever since, getting a large
                  expansion in Jul 2023 with the release of the 1.20 update and
                  its new biomes.

                <br />
                <span>
                  Azure uses several plugins such as a land claim plugin, an
                  economy plugin, and McMMO. There are also three server shops
                  that allow players to exchange certain types of wood, crops,
                  and minerals for money. For items that can't be sold to the
                  server, players can also sell them on their own by opening a
                  shop at the central town, where plots can be rented for
                  players to build stores and sell goods or services. Azure uses
                  a custom plugin to prevent inflation, allowing certain items
                  to be sold only a certain amount every 24 hours -- for a full
                  overview of how the economy on the Azure SMP works, see the
                  Azure economy guide below!
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Many players on the Azure also make lore or develop their
                  character, creating unique backstories and tying them into the
                  overall history and lore of the server and the characters of
                  other players. To see an overview of the lore and history of
                  Azure, the library on the second floor of the townhall is a
                  great place to start!

                      was held at spawn. He ran a newspaper on the server called
                      the IRIS, which copies are available in townhall's
                      library. During his first term Mary created several laws
                      including limits to how many plots a player can rent and
                      implemented a comprehensive tax code to run taxes across

                    <span>
                      During his term he also ran a writing competition for

                      town library to read by players today.

                      Mary also had multiple mobs become key figures as king and

                      starting his second term on 11/10/2022. However, this was
                      a rigged election planned by staff as a transition to a
                      major server update, which included his character being
                      the only option to vote for creating a dictatorship with
                      players not voting for him being punished. During this
                      stage Mary hired the Night's Watch, an elite team of
                      players lead by ADD_Delta to be his personal guard detail.
                      He also created laws such as 100% tax to encourage players
                      to rebel against him. During this time many buildings were
                      visibly damaged and random fires were littered throughout
                      the town, plunging things into a state of chaos and

                      have access to cheated items for their personal use. Sage

                      third mayoral election, succeeding Sage, who had become

                      changes, starting with the removal of taxes imposed by
                      Mary. He implemented several acts that defined religion
                      and charities on Azure, establishing standards for them to
                      follow. Adzey also attempted to create a court system
                      allowing players to sue and defend themselves against
                      mayoral decisions, though this system was never fully
                      implemented.

                      Adzey introduced an act around fines, enabling the mayor
                      to impose punishments on players. His term emphasized
                      enhancing communication between staff and players. He also
                      began removing inactive or poorly maintained player shops,
                      creating space for a fresh wave of player-driven activity.

                      continued making changes. He orchestrated a staff reset of
                      the end dimension and continued to clean up the town.
                      Notably, Adzey led changes to the server shops to prevent
                      inflation without taxing players. He reinstated limits on
                      the number of plots players could rent, a policy initiated
                      by Mary and revoked by Sage.

                      A significant economic shift occurred during Adzey's
                      second term with the removal of the server shops and the
                      introduction of a centralized

                      economy (this system of a diamond-backed economy was later
                      reverted when server shops reopened and the bank closed,
                      allowing players to sell certain basic resources to the
                      server again, but this time with a 24 hour limit on many
                      items that could be auto-farmed to prevent inflation).
                      Adzey also oversaw the creation of a transport bureau to
                      improve Nether tunnels, resulting in 2000 blocks being dug
                      in each direction from spawn, ready for revamping.

                      Adzey continued his efforts, creating a map and
                      information board at spawn, and introduced a law allowing
                      him to share photos and discuss his new puppy in the
                      general channel. However, due to a two-term limit, Adzey
                      did not run in the subsequent election.
